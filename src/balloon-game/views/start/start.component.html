    The aim of this game is to earn as much points as possible. To earn points
    click on the buttons below the balloon. Your temporarily earned points can
    be seen inside the balloon. To permanently collect these points click on
    "Collect" button once you are sure that the balloon cannot hold any more
    air. Each balloon has a different explosion point which keep on changing
    throughout the game. If your balloon explodes before you click on "Collect"
    you loose all the temporary points for that round.
